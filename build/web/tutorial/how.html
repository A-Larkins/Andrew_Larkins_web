            Welcome to the read me page of the audio playback length component.
            <br/><br/><br/><br/>
            <p>
                The component that I made was inspired by the desire to see the
                time remaining when listening to a sped up audiobook. Most audio
                software does not adjust the time remaining in the audiobook.
                I set out to make the nice quick calculations to see what the total
                time of an audiobook would be sped up. I thought it'd be a neat
                little program. I then thought to add a feature to show how much
                time you could save if you sped up the audiobook by a certain amount.
                So these became the 2 features of my component.

                <br/><br/><br/><br/>

                To make what I had in mind, I figured I would need buttons with
                the amount increased, like you would to speed up the audio in
                an app like audible. The options that fit best were to speed up
                the audio by x1.25, x.1.5, x1.75, and x2. The math was a bit tricky
                because I needed to keep track of proper rounding. This is because
                I would want to round down for the total hours and round up for
                minutes, and some other similar situations.

                <br/><br/><br/><br/>

                Using the component is pretty simple. You just have to click
                on which button you'd like to check out. The default hours
                and minutes are then shown at the bottom to be changed.
                You can then click on other buttons no problem, as the
                new audiobook playback time will change accordingly.
